# Basti Ki Pathshala
*Because learning should feel alive, not like reading a government PDF.*

## What Is This?
This is the **frontend** of *Basti Ki Pathshala* — a community-driven learning platform for curious minds in bastis, gallis, and anywhere knowledge is needed more than Wi-Fi speed.  
Built with pure HTML & CSS (no React, no Bootstrap, no 50 npm installs — just raw, simple code that works).

## Why Basti Ki Pathshala?
Because education should be **accessible**, **relatable**, and maybe even **fun**.  
This project aims to bring local learning content online without making it look like a 2009 cyber café website.

## Inside This Repo
- `index.html`: the main page (your entry ticket).
- `about.html`: who we are and why we exist.
- `volunteer.html`: how to get involved (voluntarily… or by peer pressure).
- `css/`: the clothes our website wears.
- `img/`: pictures, because walls of text are boring.

## Try It Out
1. **Clone this repo** or download the ZIP.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Scroll, click, explore. Break it if you want — learning happens that way.
