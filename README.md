# Basti Ki Pathshala
*Because local stories deserve a web page, even if it's just HTML & CSS.*

## What Is This?
A tiny website built with HTML & CSS (81% HTML, 19% CSS, because balance), created to... [purpose].

## Why Basti Ki Pathshala?
Born from the desire to give voice to neighborhood tales without needing a CMS or a PhD in web dev.

## Inside This Repo
- `index.html`: entry point (duh).
- `about.html`: who’s behind this, why it exists.
- `volunteer.html`: wanna help? Click here.
- `css/`: styles that make it not look like MySpace.
- `img/`: visuals (unlikely to win awards).

## Try It Out
1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser—yes, even IE (if you’re a masochist).  
3. Tinker away. If you break it, you earn it.

## Contribute?
PRs are welcome. Just promise no cat GIF spam (maybe one is fine).
